a) The -E option haults the stages of compilation directly after the preprocessing stage. The outputted content is preprocessed code. The preprocessor is the
the first step of the journey to an executable. For example, the preprocessor takes care of the #include (and all other # statements) statements and 
outputs a .i file.

the executable.

c) You get the executable. 

d) _main not found. linker command failed with exit code 1. This error essentially means that the linker was not able to find a main() function.

e) No error message. The difference is because of the '-c' option used. This stops before linking therefore it does not need a main(). Without the '-c',
