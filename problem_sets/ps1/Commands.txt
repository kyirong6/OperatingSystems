1. Runs xemacs in the background.
2. Changes directory so you can move around folders of the computer.
3. Takes the contents of ~/.bashrc file and outputting it into a file called tmpfile.txt. 
4. This creates a symbolic link (a pointer that points to the file) called tmpfile.txt to ~/tmp-alias so that the 'tmpfile.txt' name can be used.
5. This command lists all the folders in the current directory including the hidden ones. 
6. The chmod command modifies file permissions and the 'a+rwx' part will allow 'tmpfile.txt' to have read, write, and execute ability from anybody. 
7. Searches and displays lines that contain 'bash' in /etc/passwd.
8. Displays a complete list of processes that are running right now except kernel processes and pipes that data via '|' into 'more' which displays it page by page.
9. 'man' is used as an in-terminal manual to get information about a command (ex. man chown) and the number is used to specify a certain section of the manual. 
10. gcc command is used to compile C or C++ code which ouputs an executable and this specific command will do that and then move the output of error into a file called error-msg.
